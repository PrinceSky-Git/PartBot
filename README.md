# PartBot

_A modern rewrite of PartBot for Pokémon Showdown._

---

PartBot is one of the more versatile bots on Pokémon Showdown. This is its third iteration and was made as a bottom-up rewrite of the code that is now [PartProfessor](https://github.com/PartMan7/PartProfessor).

PartBot does a lot of stuff across a wide variety of platforms, with a heavy focus on gaming, PS utility, and shitposting.
